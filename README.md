# Supervised Machine Learning - Classification
## Goal
To classify properties into "Expensive" / "Not Expensive" categories with the help of Supervised Machine Learning.  

## Overview 
We are interested in making better investment decisions, and hence evaluating properties based on 70+ features, whether they qualify as expensive or inexpensive properties.

## Context
Trying out and fine-tuning a variety of Machine Learning models to get the best prediction

1. Is our Machine Learning model predicting the value of properties successfully?
2. What type of errors are most prone for each of the models?

### Task: 
* Import database of over 1500 properties
* Explore, analyze and clean over 70 features
* Try and fine-tune ML models for the best outcome

## Deliverables
**Google Colab Notebook** is found [here]().

## Skills & Tools
1. Data Reading & Cleaning 
2. Data Splitting 
3. Building a Preprocessor
4. Modelling ( Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Fine Tuning
6. Error Analysis

## In Progress
1. Perfecting the model with lazy predict
2. Voting Classifier
